Postgresql replication :-

1. There should be minimum 2 servers ( primary & secondary )
2. Primary server is the main production server and secondary server acts as a backup server of the replicated production server.
3. Purpose of replication is to act when the production server ( main ) goes down then there is election between the replicated backup servers that who will become the primary server temporarily.
4. The elected secondary server acts as a primary server and the next replica server acts as a secondary server.
5. Once the main primary server is fixed and up then he again gains his position as a primary server and others as secondary replica servers as earlier.

Mongo replication :-
1. Mongo replication is same as above but with additional server known as arbiter.
2. Arbiter server acts as an candidate in the election of server whose presence matters than that of its contribution in election.
